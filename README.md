# COMP2150  - Level Design Document
### Name: Ryan Ly
### Student number: 47615540 

This document discusses and reflects on the design of your platformer level for the Level Design assessment. It should be 1500 words. Make sure you delete this and all other instructional text throughout the document before checking your word count prior to submission. Hint: You can check word count by copying this text into a Word or Google doc.

Your document must include images. To insert an image into your documentation, place it in the "DocImages" folder in this repo, then place the below text where you want the image to appear:

```
![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<IMAGE NAME AND FILE EXTENSION>)
```

Example:

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

When the player starts the level, there are mechanics that will be introduced to the player. This will show the player on what to expect when it comes to trying to find out how to overcome the obsticles and learning how the mechanics works to or against the play. For example

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

When the player starts the level, the level will teach the player about the design of the level. However, when the player makes good progress through the level, the difficulty will become more intense as there are more enimies and more obstacles. 

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

The main challenge is the difficulty and trying to avoid obstacles. When there are challenge in the level, there can be more obsticles and more enemies combined. For example, there are more spitter appearing after the first section of the game, the spitter not only tries to slow down the player, this also keeps the player to keep moving as it does not give the player time to

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid

![Acid 2!](DocImages/Acid2.png)

Adding the acid in the beginning of the level can be a good obstacle becuase it introduces the hazard of the level.

### 2.2. Pushable Boxes

![PushableBlock 2!](DocImages/PushableBlock2.png)

Adding Pushable Boxes make the player

### 2.3. Pressure Pads

When the pressure pad is pressed, it will activate the trigger.

### 2.4. Trigger Doors

When adding trigger doors, it makes the player think about how to activate the door

### 2.5. Spikes

![Spikes 2!](DocImages/Spikes2.png)

Adding spikes also introduce another hazard of the level because this keeps the player aware

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

![Moving Platform 2!](DocImages/MPlatform2.png)
![Moving Platform 3!](DocImages/MPlatform3.png)
![Moving Platform 4!](DocImages/MPlatform4.png)

Moving platform will safely help the player getting to one side to another instead of jumping to the big gap
### 2.7. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

Staff was added to the game because there will be enimies or other mechanics that requires a staff

### 2.8. Chompers

![Chompers 1!](DocImages/Chompers1.png)
![Chompers 2!](DocImages/Chompers2.png)

Makes the player aware that the enemy will be after the player

### 2.9. Destructable Columns

The level assumes that the player has picked up the staff. Without the staff, the player can not destory a destructable column. 

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

The player will acquire the gun if interacted

### 2.11. Single Use Switches

The level assumes that the player has picked up the gun. The single use switches can only be activated when the bullet interacts with them.

### 2.12 Spitters

Assuming the player has a gun, the spitter can be attacked with either a staff or a gun.

### 2.13 Destructable Walls

Destructable walls can be destroyed by the staff

### 2.14 Health Pickups

After the player took some damages from the enimies or obstacles, health pickup will be provided because this will prevent the player from dying. This also makes the player prepare for the upcoming complex section.

### 2.15 Pass Through Platforms

The player will go through platforms to prevent going back

### 2.16 Bridge

The bridge will function when being activated

### 2.17 Keys

When the player interacts with the key, they will get it

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

## Generative AI Use Acknowledgement

Use the below table to indicate any Generative AI or writing assistance tools used in creating your document. Please be honest and thorough in your reporting, as this will allow us to give you the marks you have earnt. Place any drafts or other evidence inside this repository. This form and related evidence do not count to your word count.
An example has been included. Please replace this with any actual tools, and add more as necessary.


### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
