## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)

### 1.1. Discovery
When the player starts the level assuming that the player knows the controls, there are individual mechanics that will be introduced to the player. This will show the player what to expect when it comes to trying to find out how to overcome obstacles no matter the difficulty and learning how the mechanics work when being interacted by the player. 

For example, when the player observes the first mechanic in the level (acid), they will find out how the mechanic work. However, after discovering the first mechanic, they will discover a new different mechanic. This also applies to other different mechanics that were introduced to the level.

![Discovery!](DocImages/Discovery.png)

This will indicate to players that once the players learn about a certain mechanic, the players will become more familiar when they meet with the same mechanic again.

### 1.2. Drama
At the beginning of the level, the level introduce to the players each of the separate mechanics. However, when the player make very good progress throughout the level, there will be combined mechanics that can make the difficulty intense because after the player mastered each mechanic, the player will find out the combined mechanics in the level.

For example, after the player finishes and becomes familiarised with the mechanics, they will discover that there will be multiple mechanics happening at once like having the spitter inside the wall to act as a bodyguard of the other mechanics. This will put the player into a situation where the player has to find another way to overcome a combined mechanic.

![Drama!](DocImages/Drama.png)

This demonstrates that the player will be given one choice for the level which is to make the player complete the level at a fast pace otherwise the player will be killed if failed to do so.

### 1.3. Challenge
The main challenge is the difficulty and trying to avoid obstacles. When there are challenges in the level, there can be more mechanics and more enemies combined. The challenge not only applies to the amount of mechanics and enemies, it also applies to the complexity of the level design.

For example, when the player stumbled upon the third section of the level, there were mainly spitters surrounding the player and other mechanics.

![Challenge!](DocImages/Challenge.png)

This reveals to players that having a spitter surround the player will make the player keep moving as spitters will always attempt to stop the player from beating the level.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

At the beginning of the level, the player explores areas that the players want to find. Players can explore areas that they have not been to before. Exploring the level can also help the player to find out the ending of the level or certain area that can give them an advantage. When players explore the area before, certain case they might have to go back to a certain area to see if the player missed something or not otherwise the player will get lost very easily. 

For example, when the player nearly reaches the end of the level, there is another area that the player could explore when the player explores the area they will get something like a health pickup.

![Exploration 1!](DocImages/Exploration1.png)

This indicates that when the player explores an optional area, they will become more prepared and more ready for another challenge that the player will face.

Another example that the player can explore is in the second section of the level. When the player explores that area, there are multiple paths and the areas that the player explores will not get lost.

![Exploration 2!](DocImages/Exploration2.png)

This demonstrates that the player can get an opportunity to reexplore an area that they have been to before but will find out that another path has been opened.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)

### 2.1. Acid

1)
![Acid 1!](DocImages/Acid1.png)

2)
![Acid 2!](DocImages/Acid2.png)

3)
![Acid 3!](DocImages/Acid3.png)

Adding the acid at the beginning of the level can be a good obstacle as it introduces the player to a hazard of the level.

### 2.2. Pushable Boxes

1)
![PushableBlock 1!](DocImages/PushableBlock1.png)

2)
![PushableBlock 2!](DocImages/PushableBlock2.png)

A pushable boxes can be pushed to the pressure pad or used as a movable platform.

### 2.3. Pressure Pads

1)
![PressurePad 1!](DocImages/PressurePad1.png)

2)
![PressurePad 2!](DocImages/PressurePad2.png)

Pressure Pads will make the player discover a mechanic that will trigger another mechanic.

### 2.4. Trigger Doors

1)
![Trigger Doors 1!](DocImages/TriggerDoor1.png)

2)
![Trigger Doors 2!](DocImages/TriggerDoor2.png)

Trigger doors will prevent the player from exploring the level even further as it needs to be activated by a certain mechanic.

### 2.5. Spikes

1)
![Spikes 1!](DocImages/Spikes1.png)

2)
![Spikes 2!](DocImages/Spikes2.png)

Adding spikes also introduces another hazard of the level because this keeps the player aware that acid is not the only hazard that harms the player.

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

1)
![Moving Platform 1!](DocImages/MPlatform1.png)

2)
![Moving Platform 2!](DocImages/MPlatform2.png)

3)
![Moving Platform 3!](DocImages/MPlatform3.png)

4)
![Moving Platform 4!](DocImages/MPlatform4.png)

Moving the platform will safely help the player get from one side to another instead of jumping into the big gap.

### 2.7. Checkpoint

1)
![Checkpoint 1!](DocImages/CP1.png)

2)
![Checkpoint 2!](DocImages/CP2.png)

Checkpoints prevent players from repeating a large section of the level. For example, If the player dies on acid, the player respawns at the checkpoint instead.

### 2.8. Weapon Pickup (Staff)
1)
![Staff 1!](DocImages/Staff1.png)

2)
![Staff 2!](DocImages/Staff2.png)

Staff was added to the game because there will be enemies or other mechanics that requires a staff to hit with.

### 2.9. Chompers

1)
![Chompers 1!](DocImages/Chompers1.png)

2)
![Chompers 2!](DocImages/Chompers2.png)

Makes the player aware that the enemy will be after the player.

### 2.10. Destructable Columns

1)
![Destructable Walls 1!](DocImages/DC1.png)

2)
![Destructable Walls 2!](DocImages/DC2.png)

The level assumes that the player has picked up the staff. Without the staff, the player can not destroy a destructable column which prevents the player from exploring the level even further.

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

1)
![Gun 1!](DocImages/G1.png)

2)
![Gun 2!](DocImages/G2.png)

The gun plays the role of killing enemies at a long range and activates a single use switch.

### 2.12. Single Use Switches

1)
![Single Use Switches 1!](DocImages/SUS1.png)

2)
![Single Use Switches 2!](DocImages/SUS2.png)

The level assumes that the player has picked up the gun. The single use switches can only be activated when the bullet interacts with the switches. However, the switch can only be activated once.

### 2.13. Spitters

Adding the spitter to the level creates another obstacle for the player. This makes the player try to avoid the spit or pass through the spitter before the spitter spits.

1)
![Spitters 1!](DocImages/Spitter1.png)

2)

### 2.14. Destructable Walls

1)
![Destructable Walls 1!](DocImages/DW1.png)

2)
![Destructable Walls 2!](DocImages/DW2.png)

Adding a destructable wall will not only make the player defend from other enemies but also give the player time to rest before continuing the level. The player requires to hit the destructible wall using the staff five times before continuing.

### 2.15. Health Pickups

1)
![Health Pickups 1!](DocImages/HP1.png)

2)
![Health Pickups 2!](DocImages/HP2.png)

After the player takes some damage from the enemies or obstacles, health pickup will be provided because this will prevent the player from dying which can result in going to the beginning of the level once the player is out of health. This also makes the player prepare for the upcoming complex section and also helps when the player's health is critically low.

### 2.16. Pass Through Platforms

1)
![Pass Through Platforms 1!](DocImages/PTP1.png)

2)
![Pass Through Platforms 2!](DocImages/PTP2.png)

Pass through platforms prevents the player from going in the wrong direction of the level. 

### 2.17. Bridge

1)
![Bridge 1!](DocImages/Bridge1.png)

2)
![Bridge 2!](DocImages/Bridge2.png)

The bridge will block the player's path unless it is triggered by either a pressure pad or a single use switch.

### 2.18. Keys

1)
![Key 1!](DocImages/Key1.png)

2)
![Key 2!](DocImages/Key2.png)

The keys play an important role as three keys are the requirement for the player to successfully complete the level by opening the door at the end of the level.

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Making an iterative design really comes to play when trying to make the layout of the game. Making a prototype from a storyboard really helps when trying to find if the player can successfully make it from one jump to another and adding mechanics to see if they work against the player. Playtesting of the level also helps when testing multiple mechanics in a single encounter, making sure that the mechanics are working as intended, making sure that the triggers in the level are working correctly, making sure that the player can beat the level within the time given, make sure that every section of the level can be playable and making sure that the level is not annoying for the player to beat.

When making the level from Unity, it needs to make sure that the player tries to understand the mechanics of the game and needs to ensure that each section of the level will have a good intensity curve. Without the players understanding the mechanics of the level and starting the level with the difficulty being too hard for the player, it will make the level not being inviting to the player.

When playtesting the level, there are some mechanics that need to be added or removed from the scene because some mechanics do not work in certain areas of the level or sometimes some combined mechanics may take too long for the player to beat, there is also needs to be a lot of playtesting with the level because when finishing the level, the amount of time taken will always display a different result.

![Scrapped Storyboard!](DocImages/Scrapped.png)

When playtesting the level and timing how long it takes to beat the level, there is one scene that did not make it to the Unity level from the storyboard because it may take longer for the other players to beat the level in a certain timeframe.

However, there are improvements for the level to be better when playing level, there are a lot of destructable walls which can result in additional time to take to beat the level within the time frame and making sure that certain areas of the game are not confusing for the players to discover and explore.
